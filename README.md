# Tomato leaflet genetics 🍅🍃
Genetic mapping of individual pseudo-landmark positions along a continuous contour  

> :white_check_mark: For a tutorial reproducing the figure shown below, please see the Jupyter notebook in this repository, [tomato_leaflet_genetics.ipynb](https://github.com/DanChitwood/tomato_leaflet_genetics/blob/main/tomato_leaflet_genetics.ipynb).  

**The mapping of tomato pseudo-landmark positions relative to mean leaflet shape to genetic loci. A)** Left to right: left distal lateral, terminal, and right distal lateral tomato leaflets. The generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) mean for each is shown in magenta and superimposed leaflet outlines are transparently depicted in black. **B)** The genetic basis of leaflet pseudo-landmarks. Top to bottom: left distal lateral, terminal, and right distal lateral tomato leaflets. Left, pseudo-landmarks are assigned to ten regions along the leaflet outline, indicated by number. For quantitative trait loci with FDR BH-adjusted p values less than 0.05, a line segment normal to the associated mean pseudo-landmark position and colored by p value and direction is shown, showing the genetic effects on shape in specific leaflet locations. Right, for each leaflet type a heat map, colored by -log base 10 FDR BH-adjusted p values, for each leaflet region (Arabic numerals) by genetic bins across chromosomes (Roman numerals).
